# ⚽ Real-Time Football Match Analysis

This project provides real-time football match analysis, showing predictions, winning percentages, and player stats. It combines live data feeds, machine learning models, and data visualization to give insights into ongoing matches. The system continuously updates as the match progresses, providing up-to-date statistics and predictions.

## 📌 Features

- **Real-Time Match Data:**
  - Access live data such as goals, shots, possession, and player-specific stats using external APIs.
  
- **Match Outcome Predictions:**
  - Predict match outcomes using machine learning algorithms trained on historical data.
  
- **In-Game Predictions:**
  - Dynamic prediction updates based on real-time match events, like goals, substitutions, and more.
  
- **Player and Team Stats:**
  - Track detailed player stats including goals, assists, passes, tackles, and heatmaps.
  
- **Data Visualization:**
  - Interactive charts and dashboards to visualize match flow, predictions, and player performance in real time.

⚙️ How It Works
Real-Time Data Collection:

Match data is fetched in real-time using external APIs or web scraping.
Machine Learning Predictions:

Pre-game predictions are made using historical data.
In-game predictions are updated based on live events.
Player Stats:

Player data such as goals, assists, tackles, and passes is processed and displayed.
Visualization:

Interactive charts display match flow, player heatmaps, and win probabilities.
📊 Prediction Models
Pre-Match Predictions:

Based on factors such as previous head-to-head data, player form, and team strength.
In-Match Predictions:

Uses real-time match events (goals, fouls, etc.) to update the likelihood of a team winning or drawing.
🏗️ Future Improvements
Add support for more advanced metrics like Expected Goals (xG).
Improve player heatmap visualizations.
Integrate voice support to provide live commentary and analysis.
